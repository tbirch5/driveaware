#driveaware - AI Driver Behavior Monitoring System
# Step 1: Define the MVP goals in README.md

"""
# DriveAware 🚗🧠

A professional-grade AI system that monitors and analyzes driver behavior in real time. It detects fatigue, distraction, and anomalous driving patterns using unsupervised learning and predictive modeling.

## 🔍 Core Features
- Unsupervised learning for anomaly detection in driver inputs
- Fatigue and distraction prediction using facial landmarks and blink rate
- Real-time alerts and an interactive dashboard
- Optional HR/fleet manager dashboard for workplace wellness and safety

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- Python, scikit-learn, XGBoost
- OpenCV, MediaPipe (for facial/eye tracking)
- React, Tailwind CSS (frontend UI)
- Flask or Django (backend API)

## 📊 Datasets
- Udacity self-driving car dataset
- OpenFace/MediaPipe for facial detection
- CARLA simulator data (optional)

## 🧠 ML Components
- Autoencoder-based anomaly detection (unsupervised)
- XGBoost classifier for fatigue prediction
- Feature engineering from telemetry + vision data
